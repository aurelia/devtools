# Privacy Policy for Aurelia Inspector

**Last Updated:** August 14, 2025

## Overview

Aurelia Inspector is a Chrome DevTools extension designed to help developers debug and inspect Aurelia v1 and v2 applications. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles data when you use it.

## What Data We Collect

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user information.**

The Aurelia Inspector extension:
- **Does not collect personal information** - No names, emails, or identifying information
- **Does not track user behavior** - No analytics, usage statistics, or telemetry
- **Does not store data remotely** - All inspection data remains local to your browser session
- **Does not transmit data** - No information is sent to external servers or third parties

## How the Extension Works

The extension operates entirely within your local browser environment:

1. **Page Detection**: Detects when Aurelia applications are present on web pages you're debugging
2. **Local Inspection**: Analyzes component structures and properties within the current browser tab
3. **DevTools Integration**: Displays debugging information in the Chrome DevTools panel
4. **Temporary Data**: Component and property data is temporarily held in memory only during active debugging sessions

## Data Handling

- **Inspection Data**: Component properties, bindings, and application state are analyzed locally and displayed only in the DevTools panel
- **Session Storage**: Data is stored temporarily in browser memory and is automatically cleared when you close DevTools or navigate away from the page
- **No Persistence**: No data is saved to disk, sent to servers, or shared with third parties

## Permissions Usage

The extension requires certain Chrome permissions for core functionality:

- **activeTab**: Allows inspection of the currently active tab when DevTools is open
- **scripting**: Enables injection of debugging scripts to analyze Aurelia applications
- **host_permissions**: Allows the extension to work on all websites where developers might be running Aurelia applications

These permissions are used solely for debugging purposes and do not enable data collection or tracking.

## Third-Party Services

The Aurelia Inspector extension does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs.

## Data Security

Since no data is collected or transmitted, there are no data security risks associated with using this extension. All debugging information remains within your local browser environment.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. Continued use of the extension after policy changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
